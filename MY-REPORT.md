* **It will optimize the study companion bot's response quality** by dynamically fetching relevant information.
* **We will better understand the impact of prompt optimization** on AI-driven study assistance.

# Research Method

To achieve the automation of requirement analysis, we followed these steps:

1. **Developing Automated Prompt Engineering**
   - Implemented dynamic prompt optimization to generate structured responses.
   - Used caching to reduce redundant API calls and improve efficiency.

2. **Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Integrated Wikipedia data retrieval to enhance AI’s knowledge.
   - Processed retrieved data to extract key requirements for the Study Companion bot.

3. **Combining Both Techniques**
   - Applied prompt optimization and RAG retrieval to automate requirement analysis.
   - Generated structured insights in the form of AI-powered requirement documentation.

# Results

The integration of **Automated Prompt Engineering and RAG** resulted in:

* **More structured and insightful AI-generated requirements** for the Study Companion bot.
* **Faster requirement analysis** by automating data retrieval and processing.
* **Improved response accuracy and relevance** due to real-time information fetching.

# Further Research
